# SeriesPixelSpirals

I got the idea to do this little project from seeing [this Numberphile video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFuR97YcSLM)

I then thought of a way to try and graph primes myself after seeing this and decaided to try this pattern:

Thus evolving from just soving primes, to other [integer sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_sequence) to different types of spirals, and so on.

Let me know what you think and how I could improve on my design in the future!
